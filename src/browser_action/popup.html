<!--
   - This is the NextComic browser action popup. It is structured into panels. A panel is a
   - `body > div` that describes an entire popup view. That is to say, only one panel is shown at a
   - time. Panels will be animated into view with a short sliding transition from the right or
   - left, which are intended to give an indication of moving into and out of menus, help pages,
   - etc. Elements in the panels are automatically connected to events when in view, and
   - disconnected from events when out of view and while moving into view. Which elements are
   - connected to what events is controlled by the entries in the PANEL variable in popup.js
   -
   - The panel initially given the "active" class will be the panel initially shown. *Exactly one*
   - panel should be given the "active" class.
