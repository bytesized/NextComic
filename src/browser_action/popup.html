<!--
   - This is the NextComic browser action popup. It is structured into panels. A panel is a
   - `body > div` that describes an entire popup view. That is to say, only one panel is shown at a
   - time. Panels will be animated into view with a short sliding transition from the right or
   - left, which are intended to give an indication of moving into and out of menus, help pages,
   - etc.
